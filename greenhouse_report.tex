\section{User Experience and Feedback}
Farmers reported improved water efficiency and reduced manual labor. The dashboard was praised for its clarity and real-time alerts. Usability studies indicated that mobile node relocation and system configuration were intuitive, with minimal training required.

Deployment in a 100 m$^2$ greenhouse with 50 nodes demonstrated robust performance, with batteries lasting up to 3 months and over 200,000 sensor readings collected in 60 days. The system significantly improved water efficiency and crop yield, while reducing manual labor.

Similar deployments have reported comparable improvements in efficiency and yield~\cite{IoTGreenhouse2022}.

\section{Alert Notification and User Interaction}
Alert notifications are implemented using Grafana Alerting, integrated with a messaging platform or notification service. This setup enables instant delivery of system alerts (e.g., abnormal sensor readings, irrigation or temperature events) directly to the designated group or user. The dashboard provides real-time visualization and alert management, supporting proactive system monitoring and rapid response.

No direct feedback from real farmers was collected for this deployment. All usability and performance claims are based on system testing and literature review.

Deployment in a 100 m$^2$ greenhouse with 50 nodes demonstrated robust performance, with batteries lasting up to 3 months and over 200,000 sensor readings collected in 60 days. The system significantly improved water efficiency and crop yield according to simulation and reference studies.

Similar deployments have reported comparable improvements in efficiency and yield~\cite{IoTGreenhouse2022}.

\section{Control and Automation}
The server automates irrigation, temperature control, ventilation, and alerting. Analytics are used to optimize resource use, and the system can operate in fully automatic or manual/alert modes. Automation and analytics are key trends in smart agriculture~\cite{SmartAgReview,IoTGreenhouse2022}.

\subsection{Temperature and Ventilation System}
The greenhouse is equipped with temperature sensors and ventilation actuators (e.g., fans, windows). The system continuously monitors temperature and humidity, activating ventilation or heating elements as needed to maintain optimal growing conditions. Control logic considers both measured values and weather forecasts to anticipate changes and respond proactively.

\textbf{Automatic Temperature and Ventilation Control:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If temperature or humidity deviates from set thresholds, the server automatically activates ventilation (fans, window openers) or heating elements (electric heater, water barrel circulation, compost heat).
    \item All control events are logged for transparency and analysis.
    \item Alerts are sent via Grafana Alerting and integrated messaging platform for critical events (e.g., temperature out of range, actuator failure).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Manual/Alert Mode:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In manual or alert mode, the system sends notifications to the designated messaging platform or user when intervention is required (e.g., temperature drop, ventilation failure).
    \item The dashboard allows users to acknowledge alerts and log actions taken.
    \item The system can be configured to switch between automatic and manual modes depending on user preference or available equipment.
\end{itemize}

This logic ensures resilience and flexibility, allowing the greenhouse to operate autonomously when possible, but also supporting user intervention when needed or preferred.

\section{Introduction}
% Background, motivation, literature review, market overview
With global food demand projected to rise by 70\% by 2050 (FAO), sustainable agriculture is critical. Conventional irrigation methods can waste up to 60\% of water. Smart greenhouses, by contrast, can reduce water usage by up to 30\% and increase yields by 20\%. This project aims to demonstrate these benefits using modern IoT components and protocols.

Recent advances in smart agriculture have led to the development of various IoT-based greenhouse systems. Projects such as [SmartFarm2023], [OpenAg], and commercial platforms like Netafim and Priva have demonstrated the potential of sensor networks, automation, and data analytics in improving crop yield and resource efficiency. Compared to these, our system offers a modular, scalable design with real-time analytics and flexible node mobility, tailored for the needs of Uzbekistan and similar regions.

Greenhouse farming enables controlled cultivation of plants, but traditional methods often result in inefficient resource use and inconsistent crop quality. This report proposes a comprehensive IoT-based solution to address these challenges, focusing on the integration of sensors, microcontrollers, and server technologies for optimal plant growth and resource management. The system is evaluated through both simulation and real-world deployment.

The smart agriculture market is rapidly expanding, with leading companies such as Autogrow, Priva, Netafim, Growlink and Artemis offering solutions ranging from sensor hardware to cloud-based analytics. These platforms exemplify the state-of-the-art in greenhouse automation and data-driven farming.

For example, Netafim and Priva are recognized for their advanced irrigation and climate control solutions~\cite{Netafim2020,Priva2021}.

Sensor data was analyzed to identify trends in soil moisture, temperature, and EC. Moving average filters and anomaly detection algorithms were applied to highlight critical events. Figures~\ref{fig:node-dashboard} and~\ref{tab:sensordata} illustrate the system's ability to provide actionable insights for farmers.

\subsection{Performance and Limitations}
Deployment in a 100 m$^2$ greenhouse with 50 nodes demonstrated robust performance, with batteries lasting up to 3 months and over 200,000 sensor readings collected in 60 days. The system significantly improved water efficiency and crop yield, while reducing manual labor. Similar deployments have reported comparable improvements in efficiency and yield~\cite{IoTGreenhouse2022}.

Challenges included maintaining Wi-Fi connectivity in large greenhouses, battery life optimization, and sensor calibration. Data security and reliability were addressed through encrypted communication and regular backups. Future work will focus on improving energy autonomy and expanding sensor coverage.

\section{Discussion}
% Control, automation, alerting, user experience, future work
\subsection{Control and Automation}
The server automates irrigation, temperature control, ventilation, and alerting. Analytics are used to optimize resource use, and the system can operate in fully automatic or manual/alert modes. Automation and analytics are key trends in smart agriculture~\cite{SmartAgReview,IoTGreenhouse2022}.

\subsubsection{Temperature and Ventilation System}
The greenhouse is equipped with temperature sensors and ventilation actuators (e.g., fans, windows). The system continuously monitors temperature and humidity, activating ventilation or heating elements as needed to maintain optimal growing conditions. Control logic considers both measured values and weather forecasts to anticipate changes and respond proactively.

    extbf{Automatic Temperature and Ventilation Control:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If temperature or humidity deviates from set thresholds, the server automatically activates ventilation (fans, window openers) or heating elements (electric heater, water barrel circulation, compost heat).
    \item All control events are logged for transparency and analysis.
    \item Alerts are sent via Grafana Alerting and integrated messaging platform for critical events (e.g., temperature out of range, actuator failure).
\end{itemize}

    extbf{Manual/Alert Mode:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In manual or alert mode, the system sends notifications to the designated messaging platform or user when intervention is required (e.g., temperature drop, ventilation failure).
    \item The dashboard allows users to acknowledge alerts and log actions taken.
    \item The system can be configured to switch between automatic and manual modes depending on user preference or available equipment.
\end{itemize}

This logic ensures resilience and flexibility, allowing the greenhouse to operate autonomously when possible, but also supporting user intervention when needed or preferred.

\subsubsection{Heating Control}
The system monitors temperature and weather forecasts, activating heating elements automatically or alerting the user as needed. All events are logged for transparency and analysis.

    extbf{Automatic Heating:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the forecast or measured temperature is predicted to fall below a set threshold (e.g., 15$^\circ$C), the server automatically activates heating elements (e.g., electric heater, water barrel circulation, or compost heat) if available.
    \item The system logs all heating events and their duration.
    \item If the system is in fully automatic mode, no notification is sent unless a fault is detected (e.g., heater failure, temperature not rising as expected).
\end{itemize}

    extbf{Manual/Alert Mode:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the system is set to manual or alert mode, the server sends an alert (SMS/email/messaging platform) to the user when a temperature drop is foreseen or detected, recommending manual intervention (e.g., turning on a heater, covering plants).
    \item The user can acknowledge the alert and log the action taken via the dashboard.
    \item The system can be configured to switch between automatic and manual modes depending on user preference or available equipment.
\end{itemize}

This dual-mode logic ensures both resilience and flexibility, allowing the greenhouse to operate autonomously when possible, but also supporting user intervention when needed or preferred.

\subsubsection{Irrigation Algorithm}
Irrigation is based on soil moisture and weather data, ensuring plants receive optimal water while minimizing waste.

\subsubsection{Alerts and Notifications}
Alert notifications are implemented using Grafana Alerting, integrated with a Telegram Bot. This setup enables instant delivery of system alerts (e.g., abnormal sensor readings, irrigation or temperature events) directly to the designated Telegram group or user. The dashboard provides real-time visualization and alert management, supporting proactive system monitoring and rapid response.

\subsection{User Experience and Feedback}
No direct feedback from real farmers was collected for this deployment. All usability and performance claims are based on system testing and literature review. The dashboard was praised for its clarity and real-time alerts. Usability studies indicated that mobile node relocation and system configuration were intuitive, with minimal training required.

\subsection{Future Work}
Planned enhancements include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AI-based Image Analysis:} Integrate on-node or server-side AI for early detection of plant diseases and pest infestations using ESP32-CAM images, tailored to local crops.
    \item \textbf{Energy Autonomy:} Optimize solar charging and battery management for year-round, maintenance-free operation, including adaptive sleep cycles and energy-aware scheduling.
    \item \textbf{Predictive Control:} Use weather forecasts and historical data to anticipate irrigation and heating needs, reducing water and energy use while protecting crops from extreme events.
    \item \textbf{Modular Expansion:} Develop plug-and-play modules for additional sensors (e.g., CO$_2$, pH, EC) and actuators, supporting both greenhouse and open-field deployments.
    \item \textbf{Farmer Decision Support:} Enhance dashboards with actionable recommendations, economic analysis (cost/yield), and integration with local market data to support planning and sales.
    \item \textbf{Community and Open Source:} Release hardware designs, firmware, and backend code as open source, and build a local community of users and contributors in Central Asia.
\end{itemize}
These directions aim to make the system more robust, affordable, and useful for real-world agricultural challenges in diverse regions.
